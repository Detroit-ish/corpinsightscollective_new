# Docs Folder

This folder is the home for all additional project documentation that goes beyond inline comments and code-level explanations. It’s meant to serve as a developer’s guide, making it easy to onboard new team members and keep everyone aligned.

**What You’ll Find Here:**
- High-level architectural overviews and diagrams.
- Style guides for coding, UI, and naming conventions.
- Instructions for setting up local development environments.
- Notes on deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and release processes.
- Guides on using specific libraries, frameworks, or tools integrated into the project.
- Any other reference material that helps maintain and scale the codebase.

**How to Use:**
- Add new markdown files to document changes in architecture or design.
- Update existing documentation whenever a significant change is introduced to keep information current.
- Encourage all team members to reference and contribute to this folder, maintaining a single source of truth.
