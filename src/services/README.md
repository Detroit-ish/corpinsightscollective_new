# Services Folder

This folder contains code responsible for interacting with external data sources, APIs, and other backend services. By centralizing these integrations here, the application maintains a clear separation of concerns.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Data fetching logic (e.g., REST, GraphQL, or other APIs).
- Handling authentication and authorization flows to external systems.
- Abstracting third-party integrations, so UI components remain focused on presentation and logic rather than data retrieval.

**Guidelines:**
- Keep service functions pure and decoupled from UI or state management logic.
- Include error handling and retries where appropriate.
- Document any specific requirements or environment variables needed to interact with these services.
